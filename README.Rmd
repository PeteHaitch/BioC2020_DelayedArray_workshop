## Workshop description

This workshop gives an introductory overview of the DelayedArray framework, which can be used by R / Bioconductor packages to support the analysis of large array-like datasets.
A *DelayedArray* is like an ordinary array in R, but allows for the data to be in-memory, on-disk in a file, or even hosted on a remote server.

Workshop participants will learn where they might encounter a *DelayedArray* in the wild while using Bioconductor and help them understand the fundamental concepts underlying the framework.
This workshop will feature [introductory material](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_v4IuKLFs781pp7x0BwUxv7mwCfPLBTWu320g3lQmME/edit?usp=sharing), 'live' coding, and Q&A.

### Instructor

- [Peter Hickey](https://peterhickey.org/) (hickey@wehi.edu.au)

### Pre-requisites

- Basic knowledge of R syntax.
- Familiarity with common operations on matrices in R, such as `colSums()` and `colMeans()`.
- Some familiarity with S4 objects may be helpful but is not required.

### Workshop Participation

Students will be able to run code examples from the workshop material.
There will be a Q&A session in the second half of the workshop.

### *R* / *Bioconductor* packages used

These packages are the focus of this workshop:

- `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("DelayedArray")`
- `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("HDF5Array")`
- `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("DelayedMatrixStats")`

Please see the workshop `DESCRIPTION` for a full list of dependencies.

### Workshop goals and objectives

#### Learning goals

- Learn of existing packages and functions that *use* the DelayedArray framework.
- Develop a high-level understanding of classes and packages that *implement* the DelayedArray framework.
- Become familiar with the fundamental concepts of delayed operations, block-processing, and realization.
- Reason about potential bottlenecks, and how to avoid or reduce these, in algorithms operating on *DelayedArray* objects.

#### Learning objectives

- Identify when an object is a *DelayedArray* or one of its derivatives.
- Be able to recognise when it is useful to use a *DelayedArray* instead of an ordinary array or other array-like data structure.
- Learn how to load and save a DelayedArray-backed object.
- Learn how the 'block size' and 'chunking' of the dataset affect performance when operating on *DelayedArray* objects.
- Take away some miscellaneous tips and tricks I've learnt over the years when working with DelayedArray-backed objects.
